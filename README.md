This folder contains the files:

	NN_arch.py
	gs_scfV-mb-long.dat
	gs_scfV-mb-short.dat
	structure-long.dat
	structure-short.dat

These were created for the purposes of constructing a neural network (NN) that can predict potential energy (PE) coefficients of a given atom of silicon. 

The files that describe the structure of the 340 types of silicon atoms are:

	structure-long.dat
	structure-short.dat

The files that contain the 16 PE coefficients are:

	gs_scfV-mb-long.dat
	gs_scfV-mb-short.dat

The code for the NN is heavily commented, describing what each part of the code either does or plans to do is in:

	NN_arch.py
